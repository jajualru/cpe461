RasPi ssh setup: https://desertbot.io/blog/ssh-into-pi-zero-over-usb
ssh-keygen -R raspi0a.local
ssh pi@raspi0a.local

RasPi serial setup (TODO: check on fresh pi, may contain more steps)
ls /dev/tty*
if ttyS0 is not visible, proceed to enable
sudo vim /boot/config.txt
add the following at the end of the file: enable_uart=1
sudo reboot
ls /dev/tty*
check that ttyS0 is now visible

Ultrasonic Interrupt Pins
The ultrasonic (distance) sensor only supports special pins on the
Arduino Mega. These pins are 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, and 21. Some of these
may already be connected to the RasPi, so plan ahead while wiring!
